## PubSub Networing Assignment ##
a publish and subscribe networking assignment to implement a Hard Coded MQTT protocol over UDP. 

The topology consists of:
    - Three Clients publishing information to a Broker 
    - A Broker which sends and receives information from/to different sources
    - A Server which subscribes to information published by Clients and Publishes instructions to Subscribers via the Broker
    - Two Subscribers which subscribe to instructions published by Server

The topology will be implemented via the use of Docker containers on my local machine.
