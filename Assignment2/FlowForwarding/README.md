## Flow Forwarding Assignment

In this assignment a network topology will be designed to implement the forwarding of packets between endpoints using a series of routers which initially will each contain a flow table giving information on where packets are sent from and to.

In a later iteration the topology will contain a Network Controller that will contain these flow tables and centralise their access.

The Topology will be accessed through user input in an Application that is sent to a forwarding service where the route taken by the packet will be decided.
